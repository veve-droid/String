# String
Title: This time, No Strings Attached

Prompt the user with the following menu:

Menu:

Hexadecimal to Decimal

Substring

Count Words


Item 1 asks the user to enter a hexadecimal string. Make sure that only hexadecimal strings are accepted. Convert this to its equivalent in Decimal. Take note that the input is a string.


Item 2 asks the user to enter two strings. Determine whether the first string is a substring of the second string. Sample: st1 = “term” st2 = “determine”. In this sample, st1 is a substring of st2 (determine). “mine” is also a substring of “determine.” as well as “deter”. “terms”, “deet”, and “mne” are not substrings of “determine.” 


Item 3 asks the user to enter a string as well. It should be able to display the count or the number of words found in the string. Assume that words are separated by a space. And we define a word as a sequence of one or more characters (space not included). Sample: “count how many words.” has 4 words. “this           is            another                set.” has 4 words also.
